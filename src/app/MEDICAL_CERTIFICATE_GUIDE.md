## 🏗️ Architecture

### Component Structure

```
/components
├── MedicalCertificateModal.tsx    # Main certificate component
├── OfflineIndicator.tsx           # Offline-first UX components
├── AddVisitForm.tsx               # Modified to trigger certificate
└── LoginPage.tsx                  # Redesigned with campus image
```

### Data Flow

```
User submits form
    ↓
AddVisitForm.handleSubmit()
    ↓
logClinicVisit() → Returns visitId
    ↓
Form state transitions to success
    ↓
After 1.5s delay
    ↓
MedicalCertificateModal renders
    ↓
User selects certificate type
    ↓
Downloads or prints document
```

### Performance Optimization

**✅ No Extra Firestore Reads**
- All data passed from existing form state
- Visit ID returned from `logClinicVisit()`
- Nurse name already loaded in form

**✅ Lazy Modal Rendering**
- Certificate modal only renders after successful submission
- 1.5s delay allows success animation to complete
- No unnecessary DOM overhead

## 📄 MedicalCertificateModal.tsx

### Key Features

**Dynamic Certificate Content**
```typescript
const getCertificateBody = () => {
  switch (certificateType) {
    case 'medical_cert': // Formal medical certificate
    case 'excuse_slip':  // Class excuse slip
    default:            // Clinic visit proof (structured)
  }
}
```

**High-Quality Export**
```typescript
// PDF Generation
const pdf = new jsPDF({
  orientation: 'portrait',
  unit: 'mm',
  format: 'a4',
});

// Image Export (2x resolution)
await toPng(certificateRef.current, {
  quality: 1,
  pixelRatio: 2,
});
```

**Print-Ready Styles**
- Uses Tailwind's `print:` variant
- Removes non-essential UI elements when printing
- Maintains professional layout

## 🔧 Integration with AddVisitForm

### Modified Flow

**Before:**
```typescript
logClinicVisit() → Show success message → Close modal
```

**After:**
```typescript
logClinicVisit() 
  → Store visitId
  → Show success message (1.5s)
  → Auto-display MedicalCertificateModal
  → User downloads/prints
  → Close (returns to dashboard)
```

### State Management

```typescript
const [showCertificate, setShowCertificate] = useState(false);
const [visitId, setVisitId] = useState('');

// After successful submission
const generatedVisitId = await logClinicVisit({...});
setVisitId(generatedVisitId);
setSuccess(true);

// Trigger certificate modal
setTimeout(() => {
  setShowCertificate(true);
}, 1500);
```

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "html-to-image": "^1.11.11",

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Customization

### Change Certificate Design

Edit `getCertificateBody()` in `MedicalCertificateModal.tsx`:

```typescript
const getCertificateBody = () => {
  switch (certificateType) {
    case 'medical_cert':
      return <div>Your custom design</div>;
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Add New Certificate Type

1. Add to type definition:
```typescript
type CertificateType = 'clinic_proof' | 'medical_cert' | 'excuse_slip' | 'your_new_type';
```

2. Add case in `getCertificateBody()`

3. Add selector option:
```tsx
<SelectItem value="your_new_type">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon className="h-4 w-4" />
    <span>Your New Type</span>
  </div>
</SelectItem>
```

### Customize Logo

Replace logo imports in `MedicalCertificateModal.tsx`:

```typescript
const ndkcLogo = 'path/to/your/ndkc-logo.png';
const srbLogo = 'path/to/your/srb-logo.png';
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: PDF not generating
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Ensure `html-to-image` and `jspdf` are installed.

### Issue: Image quality poor
**Solution:** Adjust `pixelRatio` in export functions:
```typescript
await toPng(certificateRef.current, {
  quality: 1,
  pixelRatio: 3, // Increase for higher quality
});
```

### Issue: Modal not showing
**Solution:** Check that `visitId` is being set correctly after `logClinicVisit()`.

### Issue: Offline indicator not working
**Solution:** Ensure `<OfflineIndicator />` is added to your main App component.
